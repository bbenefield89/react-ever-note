# Take Notes!
Currently the main focus for this project is to create a simple note taking app than will have continuous, persistent data across multiple platforms first starting with the web. Users will be able to jot down ideas, important dates, and whatever else they feel is neccessary to organize their daily lives.

## Quick Start
The backend portion of this project boils down to the **index.js** file. From there you should be able to find your way around. There will be notes left in the files to help direct those who are lost.

Anything dealing with the frontend can be foudn in the **client** folder.

For development purposes, first clone this repo and in your terminal type 
***npm run dev***. This will start two local servers on your machine. One is for the backend, the other is the frontend.

The backend can be located at **http://localhost:3001**

The frontend can be located at **http://localhost:3000**
